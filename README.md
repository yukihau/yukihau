<h2>Hi, I'm Yuki!<img src="https://c.tenor.com/Dr5sZCODJ50AAAAi/mochi-mochi-hello-grey-cat-mochi-mochi.gif" width="75" /></h2>

<h5>I'm a Software Engineer currently working at @Cogna. My passion is creating things!</h5>
<p>I have experience with many languages, such as Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Python and PHP. I have 3 years of experience with back-end, and a little less with front-end. I'm a strong advocate of following patterns and maintaining clean code for a more organized, scalable and maintanable code!<p>

<h2>My values are...</h2>

<p>
ðŸŒŸ Self-expression and being myself<br>
ðŸ’– Treating everyone with love and empathy<br>
ðŸ“– Being open to new ideas, and free of preconceptions<br>
</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

- Full-stack TypeScript (Next.js + NestJS) with Dockerized dev setup
- Authentication, CRUD, and clean architecture layering
- CI (lint + tests) and `.env.example` for easy onboarding
