<h2>Hi, I'm Annie!<img src="https://c.tenor.com/Dr5sZCODJ50AAAAi/mochi-mochi-hello-grey-cat-mochi-mochi.gif" width="75" /></h2>

<h5>I'm a Full-stack Web Developer currently working at @KrotonTech. My passion is creating things!</h5>
<p>When I was little, I would work with software like Game Maker and Visual Studio C++ to express ideas that I had in my mind and turn them into something tangible, and to this day that is my goal!<p>

<h2>My values are...</h2>
<p>
ðŸŒŸ Self-expression and being myself<br>
ðŸ’– Treating everyone with love and empathy<br>
ðŸ“– Being open to new ideas, and free of preconceptions<br>
</p>
